# Auto Typerr

Auto Typerr is a simple Python application that allows you to simulate automated typing based on the text provided and a specific typing speed.

## Overview

This application is designed using Python's `tkinter` for the GUI, `pyautogui` for the typing simulation, and `threading` for handling the typing process separately from the main interface.

## Features

- **Text Box:** Enter the text you want to simulate typing for in the provided text box.
- **Typing Speed:** Adjust the typing speed (characters per second) using the entry field.
- **Start Typing:** Click the "Start Typing" button to initiate the automated typing process.

## How to Use

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install the required libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install pyautogui
     ```

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the `main.py` file.
   - Enter the desired text in the text box.
   - Adjust the typing speed if needed.
   - Click the "Start Typing" button to start the automated typing.

3. **Usage Notes:**
   - The application allows you to adjust the typing speed and provides a simple interface to simulate typing for the given text.
   - The text entered into the text box will be typed at the specified speed when the "Start Typing" button is pressed.
   - The typing simulation starts after a 3-second delay to allow time for setup.
